# pi-essentials

Bash script that basically installs a few useful Raspberry Pi things (Installs pi-apps and compiles Mesa for now). The purpose of this script is simple: it installs a set of essential/very very useful stuff.

# Notes

Is there anything that should be added in the script? File an issue!
